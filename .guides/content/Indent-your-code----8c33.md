This point applies to HTML as well as almost all programming languages.

**ALWAYS INDENT YOUR CODE**

Below you will find an example of HTML with and without indentation. No indentation makes it **much** harder for you and other people to read.

Good indentation not only makes it more readable, it usually also shows how code is organized logically.

Feel free to use empty lines as well to make things clearer.

## Bad

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
	"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="eng" lang="eng">
<head>
</head>
<body onload="main();">
<h1>Welcome to your first web page</h1>
<p>This is a very boring paragraph of text.</p>
<p>And this is another paragraph of text. Below is an image of a shaggy cow. Soon, we will get it to moo by clicking it. Notice that the <br> element forces a new line, not pressing enter.</p>
<img id="shaggycow" src="/img/cow.jpg">
<audio id="cowsound" src="/audio/moo.mp3" controls></audio>
</body>
</html>
```

## Good
```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
	"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="eng" lang="eng">
  
  <head>
  </head>
  
  <body onload="main();">
    <h1>Welcome to your first web page</h1>
    <p>This is a very boring paragraph of text.</p>
    <p>And this is another paragraph of text. Below is an image of a shaggy cow. Soon, we will get it to moo by clicking it. Notice that the <br> element forces a new line, not pressing enter.</p>
    <img id="shaggycow" src="/img/cow.jpg">
    <audio id="cowsound" src="/audio/moo.mp3" controls></audio>
  </body>
  
</html>
```

## Check your play code
Now check your play code and make sure it is nicely indented and laid out.
