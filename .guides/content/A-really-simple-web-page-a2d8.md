What you now see on the left hand side is our first web page. It is not pretty and it is not complicated but we can learn a lot about HTML web pages from this simple example.

Later, we will introduce *styling* which lets you make your pages look pretty.

## Using Codio
Codio is the platform you are using right now. Codio is actually an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and gives you most of the same features you find with desktop tools.


## Smaller screens
Codio tutorial modules are designed to be run on reasonably large screens. If your screen is not large, then you can adjust things as follows

- Drag the edges of panels in any direction to make more space for the panel you want to enlarge
- Zoom in using your browser controls. The View menu allows you to do this easily.
