What you now see on the left hand side is our first web page. It is not pretty and it is not complicated but we can learn a lot about HTML web pages from this simple example.

## Using Codio
Codio is the platform you are using right now. Codio is actually an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and gives you most of the same features you find with desktop tools.

Depending on your screen size you can see a bit more or a bit less of the code and the preview on the left. Feel free to adjust the width and hieght of the panels by dragging the dividers between the panels.
