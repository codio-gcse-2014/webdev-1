We just want to give you an idea of how powerful the combination of HTML and CSS can be.

Click (multiple times) on the sections in the preview to see what happens.

Don't worry in the slightest about understanding how the CSS actually works. All you need to take on board is the following

- Notice how simple the HTML is. HTML should show only the structure of the document. The heavy-lifting should be done by CSS (and Javascript). If you one day decide you want to completely change the style, you only need change the CSS.
- If you look at the HTML, you will see that you are familiar with all the elements except `<ul>` and `<li>`, which are 'list' elements, which we'll use ourselves in a later module.
- Notice that there are all sorts of effects that can be created using CSS. Play with the preview and you will see some animations and transitions. This is all done with CSS.
- If you want to achieve this sort of thing, all you need to do is gradually improve your CSS knowledge.
