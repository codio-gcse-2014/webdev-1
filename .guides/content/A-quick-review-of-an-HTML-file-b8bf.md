These are the main tags that all HTML files normally have. 

## DOCTYPE
`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that what follows is a HTML document.

## The `<html>` tag
Again, just put it in there. No need to understand this for a long time if ever. It contains our `<head></head>` and `<body></body>` tags. 

## The `<head>` tag
The `<head></head>` tags are empty for now but in a section coming up, we'll put something in there.

Whatever is in the `<head>` gets fully loaded before the browser displays the `<body>`.

## The `<body>` tag
The `<body>` is where the real action happens and it's where the bulk of the HTML content lives. 

|||important
## Closing the tags
It is **really, really important** to match your opening tags with closing tags. If you don't close them ten you may experience unexpected results or your page may not work at all. There are exceptions (`<br>`) but most tags require closing.

## In summary
What we have talked about here does not need to be memorized right now. You will see it on every page we use and you will get used to using things the right way.
