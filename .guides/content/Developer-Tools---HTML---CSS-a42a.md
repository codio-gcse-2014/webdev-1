Now we are going to play with something that may seem scary at first, but believe us - it will make your life **much easier** as a web developer.

We are going to assume that you are using the Chrome browser for these instructions but other browsers have similar tools. Firefox is a good alternative.

>Developer tools let's you see what's going on behind the scenes. You can view and play with your HTML, CSS and even your Javascript.
