## IDs
An ID is similar to a class but rather than styling many elements, it lets us style one specific element.

Again, take a look at the HTML. 

```html
<img class="sheep" id="color-sheep" src="/img/sheep-1.jpg">
```

Here, we have given an ID to this specific element by incuding `id="color-sheep"`. Now look at the CSS and you will see we can style this individual element. 

```css
# color-sheep {
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px gray;    
}
```

See how the CSS selector start with the `# ` character?

If you use an ID, then you may only use it for a single HTML element. It has to be unique within your HTML document.

In a moment, we'll see how to play with this using the browser's 'Developer Tools' utility.
