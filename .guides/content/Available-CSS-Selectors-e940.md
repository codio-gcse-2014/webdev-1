Each html element has its own set of associated CSS keywords. You'd be amazed at how many possibilities there are. You can control everything you can think of and many you can't think of.

So how do you know what CSS keywords are available for any given HTML element?

## Mozilla Reference
Rather than list out everything here, this is a great place to introduce the Mozilla CSS reference page by [clicking here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)

When you visit the page, you may be overwhelmed by the number of keyword properties available. **Don't be!**

What you should do is the following

- Think of what it is you want to change. For example, if you want to change the color, chances are, the property you are after is called `color`. So look for it and then click on it.
- When you have clicked on it you will find an explanation and some examples. Where it says `element` this means the HTML element you want to change, so it might be `h1` or `p` or `img`. 
- Try it out and see what happens. If it doesn't work then try again.
- You can and should also use Google to search for something, for example `change line height CSS`. You will find your way pretty quickly to some examples.

Experimentation is a good way to learn, so don't be afraid and be patient until you get it right.
