On the left, you'll find some ready made HTML and a starter CSS file. What we want you to do is to style your page so it looks something like the image below. 

Click on it to enlarge it if you like. You don't have to make it exactly the same and you can use your imagination however you want. You can probably make it look a lot nicer than we have.

## Basic Tasks
The following list summarises what you might want to do first

- Give the page (body) a background color
- Create an `h1` style with any font-size and color you choose
- Create an `h2` style that is smaller that the `h1` style but bigger than the normal text
- Choose appropriate properties for the regular text for the `p` elements
- Do something interesting to style the `strong` (red and a larger font size), `i` (green) and `u` (pink) elements (bold, italic and underlined)
- Anything else that takes your fancy.

## Advanced Tasks
You can also try these ...

- Put a dotted border around the image, specify the line thickness and make the corners rounded. Not sure about the dotted line? Try looking on MDN by [clicking here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) and search for `border-style`, then look at the examples.
- Put a border around the `h1` tag - yes, it works with all sorts of different elements.
- Try making the cow image only 150 pixels wide. [Look here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) again and have a go.
