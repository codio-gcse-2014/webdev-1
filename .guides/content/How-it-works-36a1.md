Now let's see how our code actually works. We'll leave you to look at the code an figure it out what is going on in details. In summary, though

- We create an empty HTML page and call `main()`
- In `main()` We add an event listener for the `click` and `keypress` events
- We create event handlers for a) creating new image elements and b) monitoring key presses for our user settings
- We also create event handlers for each new image so it can be deleted by clicking on it
