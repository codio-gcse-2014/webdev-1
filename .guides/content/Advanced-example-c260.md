This advanced example is the last thing we'll deal with in this module. Although this looks like a real mouthful, we are only introducing one new concept, which we'll explain in the next section. 

But really this is nothing more than a bigger, more interesting application.

## Instructions
This little web application lets you do the following ...

- Create a cow or a sheep in the web page by clicking on the preview page. Go ahead and click a couple of times.
- Delete the animal from the page by clicking on it.
- If you want to create a cow, press the 'c' key before clicking.
- If you want to create a sheep, press the 's' key before clicking.
- If you want to toggle between a colored animal or a black and white one, press the 't' key.
- You can press the 1, 2 or 3 keys to create 1, 2 or 3 animals.
- Try different key combinations to get different effects.

## Video
Watch the video to see how the application works.
