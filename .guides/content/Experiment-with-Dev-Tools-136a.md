Now that we have introduced you to devloper tools, play around with the the HTML, CSS and Javascript and use dev tools in teh following ways

## HTML and CSS inspection
- Inspect an HTML element starting with your preview
- Inspect a random element within dev tools
- Change a CSS value and see it take effect in the preview window
- Add a new CSS value in dev tools and see the effect in the preview

## Javscript and the debugger
- Set breakpoints in the
- Step through the code
- Check the console for any errors generated by the browser

As long as you are reasonaby comfortable with these things, that's enough for now. We'll come back to the debugger later when we move on to more advanced examples.
