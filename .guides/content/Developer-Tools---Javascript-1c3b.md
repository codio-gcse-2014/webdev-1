The developer tools let you do some very powerful things to help you out with your Javascript, too. 

- Watch your code execute line by line
- Have your code stop automatically if a variable gets changed
- Change variable values while the program is running
- Inspect variables and *objects*
- Write values and comments to the *console*
- If your code is generating errors, dev tools will show errors in the console

The video below explains how this works.

## Using the debugger in Codio
When you use the developer tools debugger in Javascript, we strongly recommend that you debug the preview in a separate, dedicated browser tab, not in an in-Codio panel. The reason for this is that Codio itself is a web application and so your application is a web app within another web app, which makes things little more complex.

It's easy to do this, just press the top left button as shown circled in the image below.
