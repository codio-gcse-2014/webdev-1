We have now created a new `index.html` page for you on the left. Create your own page by inserting content within the `<body>` tag.

- headers
- paragraphs
- the `<br>` tag to insert new lines
- an image that you find on Google images (see below)
- anything else you fancy trying out

Your preview window is empty to start with. When you want to try out your changes, press the refresh button in the Preview window.

## Finding an image on Google Images
We learned about the `<img>` tag earlier. Here's a reminder ...

```html
<img id="shaggycow" src="/img/cow.jpg">
```

`src` tells the browser where to look for the image. The above example actually gets it from the `img` folder you can see on the extreme left hand side. The `/` means "look from the bottom of the file tree" and then it looks for a folder called `img`. You should be able to see it.

To get an image from the web instead, you simply replace everything between the `" "` with a url to an image on the web.

Watch the video below for an explanation and to see how to get an image url from Google Images.

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/120383889" width="500" height="350" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

After you've selected 'Copy image URL', you put the cursor in between the `""` of your `src` attribute and paste it in.

You can right click to paste, or use the keyboard shortcuts ctrl+v or use the browser's Edit->Paste menu item.
